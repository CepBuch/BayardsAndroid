**Bayards pocket manual app**

This application should help new employees of Bayards company with safety and teach them basics of working in factories of the company. In other words, this is a guide application that makes employees get used to the company. Information is added by administrations through the web and displayed in iOS, Android and WP apps. All data is downloaded once and cached on the device with later auto-update checks.

Russian (development) and Dutch (coordination and analytics) students worked together on this project for Dutch company. My role was to create design and Android application (Xamarin). We've also developed iOS app, Windows Phone app, API, back-end and backing interface.

[Here is](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1cfqwkNCCmX5LBs97ift-lcyqnUCeOFOX) APK with the final version of Android application that was sent to the client.

Unfortunately, now it works until the first request to the server as we used free web hosting that now, after a year, is not available. Client uses their own hosting and didn't want to publish this app to Play, App and Windows Stores (for security purposes).

Due to absence of Xamarin on my PC right now (unable to change API requests to offline data as I did with [2018 project](https://github.com/CepBuch/ProduvarForCV)), I want to demonstrate very *basic* functionalities of this app through [PDF with screenshots](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1UKNKBNVyD2PZsEmzsJrFD3kSuiDj1oA9) that I am able to find in my archives now.

Main function (to display information) is very poorly described in these pictures that is why I am going to add some words.

There can also be:
- subcategories (near the "Risks" tab) and subcategories can also have subcategories and so on.
- pictures in instructions.
- expandable views to gather additional information (for example, links to youtube videos)
- checkboxes to ensure that user have looked through some necessary articles.

P.S. Now, at the moment of 2018, I can say that my skills of coding were seriously improved since this project (early 2017), but still this is an example that demonstrates my code on C# programming language and my abilities of using Xamaring tools. For more up-to-date android skills you can look at [2018 year project](https://github.com/CepBuch/ProduvarForCV) written in Kotlin.
